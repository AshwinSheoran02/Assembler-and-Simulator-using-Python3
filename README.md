This repository has a simple assmbly language compiler programmed in Python. 
This includes the two source codes named `assembler.py` and `simulator.py`.

The Folders have Folders named `Simple-Assembler` `SimpleSimulator` `AutomatedTesting`

## Contents

### Simpler Assembler
This has the assembler program which converts given assembly code into binary language.

### Simple Simulator
This has the simulation program which shows the values of the registers at different instances when a binary code gets runned.

### Automated testing
This has a lot of test cases which can be simply runned for both the Assembler and Simulator. 

## Running the Assembler and Simulator
In order to run the Assembler and Simulator first provide the persmission to the run files of Assembler , Simulator and the Testing file , which are at the following path
`/CO_M21_Assignment-main/automatedTesting/run`
`/CO_M21_Assignment-main/Simple-Assembler/run`
`CO_M21_Assignment-main/SimpleSimulator/run`
Use the command  `chmod +x run` to provide the permission to the execute the files
Then execute the run file in Automated Testing folder , `/CO_M21_Assignment-main/automatedTesting/run` , using `./run` command
